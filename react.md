# React
`React` is an open-source front-end JavaScript library, created by `Meta` (formally Facebook), to build user interfaces based on reusable components. 

+ [Install](#install)

## Install
`Vite` can be used to setup and scaffold a `React` application. This can replace - the now legacy - `create-react-app` tool that was used previously. 

Run the following terminal command and follow the prompts in the CLI. This will allow a`TypeScript` or `JavaScript` `React` application to be generated. `Vite` can also be used to setup applications using frameworks or libraries such as `Vue`, `Angular` and `Svelte`:

```shell
$ npm create vite@latest

# Yarn
$ yarn create vite
# pnpm
$ pnpm create vite
# Bun
$ bun create vite
# Deno
$ deno init --npm vite
```
