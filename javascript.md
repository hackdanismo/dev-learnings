# JavaScript

+ [Files](#files)

## Files
External scripts usually have the file extension of `.js`. These files contain `JavaScript` code used across websites and applications. To include a `JavaScript` file in `HTML`, this can be placed before the closing `</body>` tag within a `<script>` tag. The `src` attribute is used to reference to path to the `JavaScript` file to be included.

```html
<script src="scripts/script.js"></script>

</body>
</html>
```
